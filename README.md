# COMP90051-Project1 Who Tweeted That?
The purpose of this project is to predict authors of test
tweets from a large number of authors found in training
tweets. Twitter tweets are relatively self-contained and
have small sentence length variance, thus the authorship
attribution is challenging regarding the limitation of
texts. This project targets to train a machine learning
(ML) model with suitable training approaches and
methods for predicting the right author, also identifying
appropriate raw features from numerous tweets to
facilitate the training.
